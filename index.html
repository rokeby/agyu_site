        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>The Tourist, 2023, tells the story of Zanzibar, China, and Ali Sultan Issa, a man at the centre of an uneasy marriage between Afrofuturism and Sinofuturism. It explores a shifting geopolitical atmosphere from the cosmopolitan optimism of the "Bandung Spirit" declaration, signed at the first large-scale Afro-Asian Conference in 1955, to the uncertain alignments of today.</p>

        <p>Issa and his comrades sparked a diplomatic romance with communist China in the 1960s and sought to build post-revolutionary Zanzibar in the image of the People’s Republic of China. Zanzibar presented itself as China's revolutionary pupil, and a spark from which pan-African socialism would flourish.</p>

        <p>Issa was not only a leading Zanzibari socialist, but would also become its capitalist pioneer. In his "second revolution," he opened the island's first resort hotel, spearheading the foreign investment which would later define its fortunes as a tropical tourist paradise.</p>
